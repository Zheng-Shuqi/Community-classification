# Unsupervised Text Classification

This project implements an unsupervised text classification model. It utilizes the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and then performs clustering to categorize text data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new, unseen text.

Key Features:

*   Unsupervised learning approach.
*   Elbow method for optimal cluster determination.
*   Ability to classify new text data.
